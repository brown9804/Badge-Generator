> I've created this Badge generator to give the community an open-source tool for customizing and generating badges for workshops or events. Remember, no data is stored, so when you generate a badge, make sure to click save svg to download it to your local device.

## Overview

- `.github/`: Contains GitHub-specific files, such as GitHub Actions workflows.
- `src/`: Directory for source files, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
  - `index.html`: This file contains the structure and content of the web page. It includes the form for user inputs, labels, and a section to display the results. It also links to the CSS file for styling and the JavaScript file for functionality.
  - `styles.css`: This file contains the styles for the web page. It defines the appearance of the elements, such as the layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. It ensures the web page looks visually appealing and is easy to use.
  - `script.js`:  This file contains the JavaScript code that handles the logic for generating the badge based on user inputs. It processes the input data, performs the necessary operations, and updates the web page with the results.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git.
- `LICENSE`: Contains the license information for the project.
- `README.md`: Provides documentation about the project, including how to set it up and use it.
